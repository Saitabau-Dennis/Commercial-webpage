          <center><p>The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have a new 48MP primary camera, which captures more information with each shot, resulting in higher resolution images with improved detail. The camera also has a 2X sensor crop, which provides a 2X zoom with similar image quality to a dedicated telephoto camera. This feature makes the regular iPhones feel like they have a triple camera system instead of just two snappers on the back.0 The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max have more powerful sensors, with 2.44 m quad pixel sensors for the Pro devices and 2 m quad pixel sensors for the 15 and 15 Plus</p></center>
